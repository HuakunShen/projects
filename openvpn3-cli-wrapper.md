A wrapper for openvpn3 to make openvpn3 cli easier to use

There is no official openvpn GUI client on linux, `openvpn` and `openvpn3` are available but not that easy to use.

`openvpn3` has similar functionalities to GUI clients on Windows and Mac but still hard to use because users have to remember and type out the long commands.

I made a Gist Note of how to use `openvpn3` [here](https://gist.github.com/HuakunShen/b2b7169222c2c0658760777505e9eef4).

I am tired with `openvpn3`, and `openvpn` isn't as powerful, so I wrote a simple bash script as a wrapper of `openvpn3` client to make my life easier.

You can import, connect, disconnect ... with the simpliest commands.
