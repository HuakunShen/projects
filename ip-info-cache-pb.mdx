title: IP Info Cache
---

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/HuakunShen/ip-info-cache-pb

In some of my projects, I need to visualize IP addresses on a map, thus I will need to get the longitude and latitude of the IP address.

IP info APIs costs money. e.g. ipgeolocation.io has a free tier of 30k requests/month.

It's hard to request 30k unique ips in a month, but if the same ip address is checked frequently the free quota could be used up quickly. Thus I built this simple cache server. This cache server is used as a proxy server, requests sent to `/api/info/<:ip>` is forwarded to API service and cached in pocketbase.

## Why Pocketbase?

Key value DB like redis is usually used for caching, however Redis memory is expensive. 
We may need to store millions of ip addresses.

[Pockethost](https://pockethost.io/) provides free pocketbase service. So I deployed a pocketbase service on pockethost and built this simple cache server.
