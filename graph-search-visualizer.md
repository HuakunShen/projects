# Graph Search Visualizer

> This is one of my first web app when I first started learning. In the meanwhile I was learning AI algorithms, and I thought it would be interesting to write a visualization for the algorithms.
>
> It's completely written in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. If I were to rewrite it, I would use TypeScript, framework like React or Vue, and an animation library like p5.js
>
> This is a milestone, the starting point of my web development journey. Although it's not the best code I've written, it's still a good memory.

This is a graph search visualizer that visualizes different graph search algorithms. The user can choose the start node and the end node, and the algorithm will find the shortest path between the two nodes. The user can also choose the speed of the visualization.

## Algorithms Supported

- BFS
- DFS
- A\*
