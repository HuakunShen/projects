# mturk-vue-template

GitHub: https://github.com/HuakunShen/mturk-vue-template

Mturk is a ugly platform. Not surprise as it's built by Amazon.

I've seen ugly vanilla JS HTML code for mturk projects with thousands of lines of code in a single html file.

This is a template for building mturk projects with Vue.js. Components are much easier to maintain and reuse.

## Tech Stack

- Vue.js
- TypeScript
- Mturk
