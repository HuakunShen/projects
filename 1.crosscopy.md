# CrossCopy

https://crosscopy.io/

[GitHub Orgnization](https://github.com/CrossCopy)

> CrossCopy is a cloud based clipboard manager aiming to provide a seamless cross-platform data transfer solution.

It's the largest personal project I've ever worked on. It's a full-stack project with a lot of technologies involved. I've learned a lot from it.

Full-stack here is not limited to web development (frontend and backend). It also includes mobile development, desktop development, mobile apps, cloud infrastructure, and much more.

We attended [University of Toronto's Hatchery Program](https://hatchery.engineering.utoronto.ca/) to prepare this project as a startup.
