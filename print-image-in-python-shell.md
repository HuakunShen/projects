# Print Image In Python Shell

GitHub: https://github.com/HuakunShen/printImageInPythonShell

This is probably my first personal Python project. I was a first year CS student back then.
I was learning Python and I thought it would be cool to print an image in the Python shell.

The program reads the image pixel by pixel, and print a character based on the pixel.

The program is very simple, but it's a good starting point for me to learn Python.

Memorial milestone of my programming journey.
